description: Resolve biweekly audit findings from a GitHub issue into a PR. Classifies each finding (behavior change → /tdd, pure refactor → test-gate, config/type → lint-gate), processes them in order, commits individually, and creates a PR linked to the issue. Use when the user says "resolve audit", "fix audit findings", "process audit issue", references a biweekly audit issue by number, or wants to act on /improve-codebase-architecture or /tech-debt-audit output.

# Resolve Audit

A Claude Code skill that takes a biweekly audit issue (produced by
`/improve-codebase-architecture` + `/tech-debt-audit`) and methodically
resolves every finding into a single PR with per-finding commits.

When invoked via `/resolve-audit`, follow the protocol below.

---

## Phase 0: Read and Classify

Do not write any code in this phase.

1. Get the issue number from the user. Read it:
   ```
   gh issue view <NUMBER> --json title,body
   ```

2. Parse every finding from both the Architecture Analysis and
   Tech Debt Audit sections. Include findings from all severity
   levels. The only items to exclude are those listed under
   "Things that look bad but are actually fine" (acknowledge them
   and set aside).

3. Classify each finding into exactly one category. See
   [classification-guide.md](references/classification-guide.md)
   for detailed criteria and edge cases. The short version:

   **Category A — Behavior Change**: observable output changes,
   new error handling, API changes, shallow→deep module rewrites.
   These require `/tdd` (Red-Green-Refactor).

   **Category B — Pure Refactor**: god file splits, circular dep
   removal, dead code deletion, module relocation, duplication
   consolidation. External behavior must not change. Existing test
   suite is the gate. New tests are forbidden.

   **Category C — Config/Type/Dependency**: lint rules, type
   annotations, package updates, CI config, documentation fixes.
   Compiler or linter is the gate.

4. Print the classification table:
   ```
   | # | Finding (≤60 chars) | Cat | Severity | File(s) |
   |---|---------------------|-----|----------|---------|
   | A-1 | Missing error handling in parser | A | High | src/parser.cpp |
   | B-1 | Split god file utils.py | B | Medium | src/utils.py |
   | C-1 | Add type annotations to config | C | Low | src/config.ts |
   ```

5. Present the table and wait for user confirmation before
   proceeding. The user may reclassify items or exclude some.

6. After confirmation, create a working branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b fix/audit-<ISSUE_NUMBER>
   ```

## Phase 1: Category A — /tdd

For EACH Category A finding, in order:

1. Announce: `── A-{n}: {finding summary} ──`
2. Activate the `/tdd` skill methodology.
3. **Red**: Write a failing test that captures the missing or
   incorrect behavior. Run the test. Confirm it fails.
4. **Green**: Write the minimum code to make the test pass.
   Run the test. Confirm it passes.
5. **Refactor**: Clean up while keeping the test green.
6. Run the full test suite to verify no regressions.
7. Commit: `fix(audit): A-{n} {concise description}`
8. Proceed to the next item.

If a `/tdd` cycle reveals that a Category B item actually changes
behavior, reclassify it as A and process it here.

If there are zero Category A findings, skip to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Category B — Refactor with Test Gate

For EACH Category B finding, in order:

1. Announce: `── B-{n}: {finding summary} ──`
2. Run the full test suite BEFORE touching code. Record:
   - Total tests, passed, failed, skipped.
   - If any test fails pre-change, STOP and report it. Do not
     proceed with this item until the pre-existing failure is
     understood.
3. Perform the structural change.
4. Run the full test suite AFTER the change. Compare counts:
   - Pass count must be ≥ previous. Zero new failures.
   - If a test breaks, the change altered observable behavior.
     Undo, reclassify as Category A, and process with `/tdd`
     in a later pass.
5. Commit: `refactor(audit): B-{n} {concise description}`

Do NOT write new tests for Category B. The existing suite is the
contract. Writing "tests that verify the refactor worked" couples
tests to internal structure, which is the anti-pattern `/tdd`
explicitly warns against.

If there are zero Category B findings, skip to Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Category C — Config/Type/Dependency Gate

For EACH Category C finding, in order:

1. Announce: `── C-{n}: {finding summary} ──`
2. Apply the change.
3. Verify: compiler passes, linter passes, or dependency
   resolves without conflict.
4. Commit: `chore(audit): C-{n} {concise description}`

If there are zero Category C findings, skip to Phase 4.

## Phase 4: Final Verification and PR

1. Run the full test suite one final time.
2. Run the linter.
3. Print a completion checklist:
   ```
   ✓ A-1: Missing error handling in parser
   ✓ B-1: Split god file utils.py
   ✗ B-3: Remove circular dep (reclassified → A-4)
   ...
   Total: {resolved}/{total} findings resolved
   ```

4. For any unresolved finding, explain why concisely under the
   checklist. Acceptable reasons: pre-existing test failure,
   requires human decision, depends on external system, would
   exceed scope. "Seemed hard" is not acceptable.

5. Create the PR:
   ```
   gh pr create \
     --title "fix: resolve audit findings from #<ISSUE>" \
     --body-file <(generate PR body per template below)
   ```

   PR body template:
   ```markdown
   Resolves #<ISSUE>

   ## Behavior Changes (TDD applied)
   - A-1: {description}
   - A-2: {description}

   ## Refactors (existing test suite verified)
   - B-1: {description}
   - B-2: {description}

   ## Config/Type/Dependency
   - C-1: {description}

   ## Not Resolved
   - B-3: {reason}

   ## Test Results
   - Full suite: {passed} passed, {failed} failed, {skipped} skipped
   - New tests added: {count} (from Category A items)
   ```

6. Link the PR to the issue:
   ```
   gh issue comment <ISSUE> \
     --body "Addressed in PR #<PR_NUMBER>."
   ```

## Rules

- **Never skip a finding.** If unresolvable, mark as Not Resolved
  with a reason. Omission is a defect; non-resolution is a judgment.
- **Never apply /tdd to Category B.** The test suite is the gate.
- **Never commit without verification.** Tests for A/B, linter for C.
- **One finding per commit.** Do not squash unrelated changes.
- **Ignore .ipynb files entirely.** They are legacy artifacts.
- **Documentation-only findings are always Category C.**
- **Wait for user confirmation after Phase 0.** The classification
  table is the contract for all subsequent work.

## Customization

Override this skill at the project level by placing a modified copy
at `.claude/skills/resolve-audit/SKILL.md`. Common customizations:

- Adjust test commands (e.g., `cargo test` vs `pytest` vs `npm test`)
- Add project-specific classification rules
- Change commit message prefix conventions
- Add severity thresholds (e.g., skip Low severity in automated runs)
